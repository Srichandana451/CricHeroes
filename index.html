                    <i>Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century,
                         and in the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. 
                         It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788 and 
                         the sport reached New Zealand and South Africa in the early years of the 19th century.

                    <i>The era of playing aggressive cricket and 
                        to have the mid-on up is gone. 
                        You now try to read the mindset of a batsman.

What other sport is there which involves people dressing all in white and then throwing themselves around a muddy, grassy field? But those in the know treasure the game as simply the supreme test of brains and brawn.
